## Who I am
I'm a student that loves C++ as well as Golang and currently I'm so much into coding cheat for PC games. 

I can speak **English** and **Japanese**.

## What do i do
I've worked on a cheat running on CSGO called <a href="https://github.com/s3pt3mb3r/Dainsleif" rel="noopener">**:zap:Dainsleif**</a> for a couple of months.

Furthermore, these days I've been concentrated on creating <a href="https://github.com/s3pt3mb3r/GameOffsetDumper" rel="noopener">**:mag:GameOffsetDumper**</a> which allows you to re-find offsets after game's updated.

Feel free to visite these repositories if you're interested in my works.
