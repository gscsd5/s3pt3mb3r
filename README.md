## Who I am
I'm a student that loves C++ as well as Golang and currently I'm so much into coding cheat for PC games. 

I can speak **English** and **Japanese**.

I've worked on a cheat running on CSGO called <a href="https://github.com/s3pt3mb3r/Dainsleif" rel="noopener">:zap:Dainsleif</a> for a couple of months.

I'll be creating cheats that is able to perform on other games. I think the next one will be for Cyberpunk 2077 if it won't come out with an anti-cheat.
Needless to say, the form will be more like MOD rather than cheat but fundamental system in which I'm interested is same
